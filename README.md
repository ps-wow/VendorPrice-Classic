# VendorPrice-Classic

A simple lightweight addon that shows the vendor sell price of an item on hover.

This addon has been superseded by [SniperTips](https://github.com/ps-wow/SniperTips) and [SniperTips_VendorPrice](https://github.com/ps-wow/SniperTips_VendorPrice), with a more modular approach to tooltip manipulation.  SniperTips uses the Ace3 framework to provide configuration and addon management.

## Why?

This addon is useful for that dreaded moment your bags are full and you want to decide which item to delete.
